  <h3> <font color=#FF7F50> The goal of this project is to reflect on all the work that has been done this semester and look back at what I can improve on 
    and what I did well. Below you'll see several different components from any of the projects that I have worked on this semster and an answer to
    a different well directed reflection question. Click on each subject link and it will take you to the example of each component. The answer to each 
    reflection question is either listed below or in the link to the subject. Hope you enjoy! </font></h3>

      <h2><li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081227100740/http://trinity.aas.duke.edu/~jvigdor/segregation/1990trct.txt" target="blank">A dataset I manipulated using Python</a></li></h2>
      <h3>Above is the link to the dataset that I manipulated for both my Synthesis 1 and 2 assignment. The question that I want to answer here is how did my manipulation of the data
      affect the way in which the audience viewed the data. My method of visualizing this data was to create a graph of the United States to visual the population density fo black and brown people in each state.
      I also created a seperate graph of the population density of white people in the US as well to compare it to that of the black and brown population. The goal of this was to visualize the segregation of black 
      and brown people within the US> The manipulation of the data gave the audience a visual that was direct and vivid. When many people look at numbers they are just that numbers and as a result they don't 
      really think about them unless they unerstand what those numbers mean. However when you take the data and create a plot of white and black/brown people someone is easily able to see the segration for themselves.
      It also becomes more realavant to them as well. Everyone who is from somewhere in the US can see their state and ask themselves do I really see this data reflected in my city or state and why.
      An audience now doesn't just see the information and think "oh those numbers seem pretty good or bad", but they can clearly see the difference  between the population within their state. It causes them
      to think deeper about why this segregation exists and are they aware or concious that this is occuring.</h3>
