  <h2> <font color="gold"> The goal of this project is to reflect on all the work that has been done this semester and look back at what I can improve on 
    and what I did well. Below you'll see several different components from any of the projects that I have worked on this semster and an answer to
    a different well directed reflection question. Click on each subject link and it will take you to the example of each component. The answer to each 
    reflection question is either listed below or in the link to the subject. Hope you enjoy! </font></h2>
